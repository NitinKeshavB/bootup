# Python files 

## Concept 

Great work on refactoring your code into neat Python functions. The next step towards improving our code is to use Python files instead of Jupyter Notebooks. 

Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool to write Python code when we are looking to validate the outputs of our code in a quick, visual and interactive way. Jupyter Notebooks are however not a great tool when we are looking to productionise our Python code. 

Jupyter Notebooks lacks certain features that Python files has to offer. For example: 

- Ability to import Python files as modules, including classes, functions and variables within the files
- Ability to test Python files 
- IDE features such as code intellisense, code autocompletion, hover for code docstrings 

For those reasons, we are going to focus on using Python files wherever possible, and only look to bring in Jupyter Notebooks again in special cases. 

## Implementation 

The instructor will implement the following: 

1. Copy code from Jupyter Notebooks into an empty Python file 

2. Run the Python file from the command line using `python <your_file_name>.py`
