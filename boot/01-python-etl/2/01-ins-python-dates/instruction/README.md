# Python dates 

When building ETL pipelines, we often have to work with dates and time. For example: 

- Date and time fields within the dataset 
- Date and time metadata ranges of the dates we want to process data from and to 
- Date and time of the ETL pipeline runs 

That is why it is important for us to learn some techniques when working with dates and getting them into the right format. 

We will be using Python's [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module to work with dates.
