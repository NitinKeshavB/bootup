# Modularising code 

## Concept 

Like we covered off previously, we had taken our code from Jupyter notebooks and converted them to python files. 

Python files allow us to: 

- Ability to import Python files as modules, including classes, functions and variables within the files
- Ability to test Python files 
- IDE features such as code intellisense, code autocompletion, hover for code docstrings 


## Implementation 

I will now demonstrate how you can modularise your code (revision from last time).
