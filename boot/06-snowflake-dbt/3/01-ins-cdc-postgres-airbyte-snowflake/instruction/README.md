## Concept 

In the Airbyte week, we have seen a few ways to extract data.

Extracting data directly from source tables can have several downsides: 
- Introducing load directly to source tables 
- Requires a cursor field based on a timestamp to fetch data incrementally

However, we can extract data using a table's transaction log. This approach is known as Change Data Capture (CDC).

Benefits of this approach: 
- The query does not impact the source table. 
- Only new transactions are extracted without the need for a cursor field based on a timestamp. 
- Amortised ingestion load in the target database

To support log-based CDC, Airbyte uses Debezium, an open-source platform that constantly monitors your databases, allowing your applications to stream database row-level changes. Airbyte is engineered to use Debezium as an embedded library, so you donâ€™t need to worry about knowing its specifics.

CDC is often a common option in many commercial data tools. There are cloud natives ones as well e.g. AWS DMS.
