# Create ksqlDB Server


Before we we can make ksql queries in the console, we first need a ksql server started up.

In the previous exercises, we did this using docker-compose and the ksql-server service.


## Creating a ksql Cluster

1. Navigate to the newly created cluster. One the side you should see a kqlDB menu option
2. Once there, click on `Add Cluster`
3. Select the `Global Access` for your access control, similar to the connector and continue.
4. Select a cluster name that makes sense and stick to the default cluster size; it's all we need. Launch the cluster!
5. The cluster start up will take a few minutes.
